            <h1>Introduction & Background</h1>

            <p>Hi there! My name is Jonathan Beadling (you can just call me Jon). This is my capstone project for my
            application into the #VetsWhoCode program. So a little background info on myself. I join the Marine Corp in
            2007 at 19 years old. About a year in while stationed in Camp Lejuene I served 1 tour in Iraq (operation OEF). 
            Afterwards I served out the rest of my time in Japan at Camp Fuji until I got out in 2011.</p> 
    
            <p>After the service I went to college on the GI bill, getting degress in Political Science and IT. Since 2016
            I've been working in the IT field starting from help desk to roles in tier 3 support and NOC positions.</p> 
    
            <p>I've always been a power user when it came to PCs so I naturally gravitated to the IT field. Whether
            it's building a new Desktop, playing with linux distros, or doing dumb things with software I've always
            been inclined to those sort of activities. </p>
